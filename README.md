# crypto-pair-trading

### **Overview**
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing several pair trading strategies designed to minimize risk while maximizing returns. These strategies focus on profiting from relative price movements between cryptocurrencies, leveraging correlations and market dynamics.
<br>
<br>

### Included Strategies
Please look into the respective Jupyter notebook for more explanations and details.

1. **Pairs-Trading (Mean Reversion) Strategy Analysis** (*cointegration-pair-trading.ipynb*)

Pair Trading Mean Reversion strategy is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling two correlated financial instruments, such as stocks, ETFs, or currencies, to profit from the relative price movement between them.

2. **Pairs-Trading (Negative / Low Correlation) Strategy Analysis** (*correlation-pair-trading.ipynb*)

The negative/low correlation pairs trading strategy involves taking advantage of the performance divergence between two loosely correlated or negatively correlated assets by longing the stronger asset and shorting the weaker one.

3. **Pairs-Trading (Beta Neutral) Strategy Analysis (Auto)** (*beta-neutral-pair-trading-auto.ipynb*)

The beta neutral trading strategy is a market-neutral approach designed to eliminate systematic market risk by constructing a portfolio that has a net beta of zero. This strategy aims to generate alpha (excess returns above the market) by taking both long and short positions in securities such that the overall portfolio is insulated from broad market movements. This notebook uses CVXPY package to optimise portfolio weights given a set of data.

4. **Pairs-Trading (Beta Neutral) Strategy Analysis (Manual)** (*beta-neutral-pair-trading-manual.ipynb*)

The strategy analysis is the same as 3., but this notebook allow users to manually set the portfolio weights and plot the returns of portfolio compared to market.

5. **Crypto Sentiment on Chart Analysis** (*crypto-sentiment-on-chart.ipynb*)

This notebook aims to explore the potential relationship between sentiment on 4chan's Business and Finance board and the price action of selected cryptocurrencies. 4chan is a valuable source for sentiment analysis as its posts are freely accessible via its API, making it a cost-effective alternative to platforms like Twitter. The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate whether sentiment derived from 4chan posts can be correlated with the price movements of specific cryptocurrencies. By binning 4chan posts into specific time intervals and aligning them with cryptocurrency price charts, we can calculate a net sentiment score for each bin and observe any patterns or trends that may emerge.

6. **Volatility Analysis** (*volatility-trading.ipynb*)

This notebook aims to provide insights into price fluctuations and helping traders assess risk and identify profitable opportunities. In this analysis, several volatility metrics are calculated to give a comprehensive view of asset behavior and market risk.

    ```
- The data will be downloaded as *.pkl* file in the ***saved_data*** directory.
    - The ***saved_data*** directory is organised in this manner:
        ```
        saved_data/
            binance/
                1h/
                    <Asset 1 Price Data .pkl>

    - Price data in each path will be overwritten *data_manager.py* is ran with the same argument value for *CEX* and *Interval*. Eg.
        - The command below will download price data into the ./saved_data/binance/1d/ path.
            ```
            python data_manager.py -c binance -i 1d -l 365
            ```
        - The command below will delete and replace the price data in the ./saved_data/binance/1d/ path.
            ```
            python data_manager.py -c binance -i 1d -l 730
            ```

#### Social Media Post Data Download
- To use the *crypto-sentiment-on-chart.ipynb* notebook, you need to download social media post data. 
- Currently, only post data from 4chan and selected dataset from Hugging Face can be download.

    - Run the command below:
        ```
        python data_manager.py
        ```
    - The data will be downloaded as *.pkl* file in the ***social_media_analysis/saved_data/4chan/*** directory.
    - The data will be updated whenever the download command is ran. The dataframe in the *.pkl* will increase in size.
- To download the selected dataset from Hugging Face:
    - Change directory to *social_media_analysis*
        ```
